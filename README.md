This simulation creates a virtual economic ecosystem where 50 autonomous agents with distinct behavioral patterns make independent buy/sell/save decisions based on market conditions, personal wealth, and risk tolerance. The system provides real-time visualization of market dynamics, wealth distribution, and agent interactions across various economic scenarios.
